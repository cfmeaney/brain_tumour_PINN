ISNERT LINK

The code is easily adaptable, and more details can be found in the accompanying publication.

The Python version used was 3.7.6. The requirements.txt file gives the packages required to run the code.

The Data folder has several datasets which can be used in the code. The IRK_weights folder has the weights for the possible q values selected in the code.
